\f0\fs24 \cf0 bonus proposal: \
\
My idea for a bonus add on to the game of life app, is to add a screen where you would do the game of life, but it would become more of a game. You would have a limited number of dots that you could turn on at the start, and you would get score through how many were alive at the end of each step. you would be able to pause the scene and adjust the formation, but the player would have to place all the living tiles back before resuming. I would also add in a simple mutations function which would balance the game against stable formations that will never die. I would also add in the statistics view a counter that would say the overall high score. This score would be saved between runs of the app.}
